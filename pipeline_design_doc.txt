Data Pipeline Pseudocode:

Start with fc32 file of binary data

Grababout 50 frames worth of data at a time

* if bluetooth remove white space

Reshape the data into the appropriate 64x256 shape

Fourier transform columns to get 256x256 frame

Preprocess to normalize data

Save frames as numpy array (concatenate)

* For high SNR data add noise by combining processed frames

Take concatenated list and convert to jpeg

Label images with bounding boxes

Separate into test and training sets

Train NN



Creating Noise Image Directory

- Go through each game on idc-nas
- Run preprocess on whichever fc32 file from each game is best (maybe need to convert sc16 to fc32?)
- Use jupyter notebook to store images in a folder called noise-images in ML directory
